## Introduction
Source code of **Traffic crash characteristics in Shenzhen, China from 2014 to 2016**.

This project is based on a 3-year (2014-2016) dataset of police-reported traffic crashes in Shenzhen, China. The data were
obtained from the [Information Sharing Platform for Road Traffic Safety Research](http://rsrp.tmri.cn/) in China. 
In total, 237,255 crashes were reported in the 3 years where 436,412 traffic participants were involved in these crashes.

This repository does not contain any raw data or intermediate datasets. 
The scripts under src/ show the complete process of data analysis including 
preprocessing, descriptive analysis, modeling, and visualizing results.
